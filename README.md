# Influence-of-Lemmatization-and-Stemming-in-the-Word-Frequency-Text-Summarization
The aim of this study was to determine which method would be most efficient for generating summarization using the word frequency text. Three forms were analyzed: without any method, lemmatization  and stemming. The rouge metrics were used as a score. The generation of summaries using the method of stemming was more suitable.
